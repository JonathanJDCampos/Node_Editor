# ImGui Node Editor Example (GLFW + OpenGL3 + CMake on Windows)

This project demonstrates how to integrate the [ImGui Node Editor](https://github.com/thedmd/imgui-node-editor) with a modern OpenGL3 rendering backend and GLFW for window/context creation. It's a minimal, yet complete example intended to help developers quickly get started with node-based UI using [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui).

The intended use is as template for other projects.

## ‚ú® Features

- üß± Uses [imgui-node-editor](https://github.com/thedmd/imgui-node-editor)
- ü™ü GLFW for cross-platform window management
- üî≤ Modern OpenGL 3 rendering pipeline
- üßÆ GLM for math/vector/matrix operations (included for later use)
- ‚öôÔ∏è Built with CMake
- üñ•Ô∏è Developed in VS Code with Clang on Windows
